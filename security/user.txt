need to make some changes to the code and add new functionality to create a fully functional movie site.
Here are some steps that you can take to create a movie site:

    Define your movie model: You'll need to create a new Mongoose model for your movie data, including properties like title, release date, cast, etc.

    Implement a movie database: You'll need to create a new MongoDB database to store your movie data, and implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for the movie data.

    Create a front-end: You'll need to create a front-end for your movie site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This front-end should include pages for displaying movie information, browsing movies, searching for movies, and more.

    Add user authentication: You'll need to add user authentication to your movie site so that users can create accounts, log in, and manage their own movie data.

    Add movie search functionality: You'll need to implement a search function that allows users to search for movies by title, cast, release date, or other criteria.

    Add movie recommendation functionality: You'll need to implement a recommendation function that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history and other data.

    Add movie rating functionality: You'll need to implement a rating function that allows users to rate movies they've watched.

    Add movie commenting functionality: You'll need to implement a commenting function that allows users to post comments on movies.

    Style the site with a movie theme: You'll need to style your site to give it a movie-themed look and feel, you can use a theme such as medieval XV century.

    Deploy the site to a server: You'll need to deploy your movie site to a web server, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, so that it can be accessed by users on the internet.
